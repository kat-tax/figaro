# Figaro

> The Figma React Toolchain

The goal of our [Figma Plugins](https://figma.com/@kattax) is to bridge Figma to React. Design components in Figma, program them in React. The focus is on one way conversion from Figma to React. Two way syncing will be added in the future.

## [React Component Builder](./builder)

> Transforms Figma components to React components in real time. You can configure the editor, code output, plugin display, and more.

## [React Component Picker](./picker)

> This plugin is *not available yet*. It will allow you to drop existing components into Figma so you can design new components with existing ones. Let me know if you're interested, it drives development.
