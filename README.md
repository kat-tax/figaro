# Figaro

> The Figma React Toolchain

Transforms Figma components to React components in real time. The goal is to bridge Figma and React. You design components in Figma, then program them in React. The focus is on one way conversion from Figma to React. Two way syncing will be focused on in the future.

## Getting started

[Install the plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/821138713091291738), open it in Figma, and click on a [Figma component](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Guide-to-Components-in-Figma) or its children. The plugin will generate React component code and render a preview.

To change the settings, click the cog icon and edit the JSON. Settings will save and update in real time. You can change the configuration of the editor, plugin, compiler, code output, and more.
