# Figaro

> The Figma React Toolchain

The goal of our [Figma Plugins](https://figma.com/@kattax) is to bridge Figma and React. Design components in Figma, program them in React. The focus is on one way conversion from Figma to React. Two way syncing will be added in the future.

## [React Component Builder](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/821138713091291738)
> Transforms Figma components to React components in real time. Click on a Figma component or its children and the plugin will generate React code and render the generated component in a preview. You can change the configuration of the editor, plugin, compiler, code writer, etc in realtime. [Install the plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/821138713091291738), run it, then select a [Figma component](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Guide-to-Components-in-Figma). The editor will display the generated React Component code in real time. Click the cog icon and edit the JSON to change settings. Settings will save and update in real time.

## [React Component Picker](./picker)
> This plugin is *not available yet*. It will allow you to drop existing components into Figma so you can design new components with existing ones. Let me know if you're interested, it drives development.
