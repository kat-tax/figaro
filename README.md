# Figma Plugins

The goal of our [Figma Plugin Collection](https://figma.com/@kattax) is to bridge Figma to React Native. One way conversion from Figma is the focus. Two way syncing will be added in the future.

## [React Component Picker](./picker)

This plugin is *not available yet*. It will allow you to drop existing components into Figma so you can design new components with existing ones. Let me know if you're interested, it drives development.
